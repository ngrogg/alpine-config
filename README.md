# Alpine Config
An attempt at a BASH script to configure a blank Alpine Linux install

## Overview
Script is designed for a blank Alpine Linux install. Script should be run as "normal" non-admin user.
Script will configure based on "NetworkManager", "Desktop", and "Fonts" tutorials in Alpine linux documentation. Does not configure WIFI!
May not fit all use-cases, strongly recommend against just running without reading.

wget command for script on a fresh install,
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngrogg/alpine-config/refs/heads/testing/alpineConfig.sh
