# Alpine Config
An attempt at a BASH script to configure a blank Alpine Linux install

## Overview
Script is designed for a blank Alpine Linux install. Script should be run as "normal" non-admin user.
Script will configure based on "NetworkManager", "Desktop", and "Fonts" tutorials in Alpine linux documentation. Script does not configure WIFI!
May not fit all use-cases, strongly recommend against just running without reading.
